Two csv files:
census-income.data.csv and census-income.test.csv which were
given to us as training data and test data.


One python file:
which contains the complete code of our projects,
notations and commons were given at the beginning of each section which
explains the function of each section. 


Census_Income_Prediction.ipynb file:
This file requires Jupyter notebook to open, where you just need to upload the file to Jupyter notebook and each section is showed. However, if you run by this way, you need to have the correct path setting for the two csv file( the dataset file). Make sure the code is able to access the data file, otherwise it will not run properly.

Both of the files contain the same materials which is our final report.
